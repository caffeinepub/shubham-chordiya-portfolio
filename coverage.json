Each card must include: Industry, Market, Budget, Platforms, Objective (2–3 sentences), Strategy (at least 5–7 detailed tactical bullet points covering audience targeting, creative approach, bidding strategy, funnel structure, tracking setup, and optimisation methods), Results (at least 4–6 quantitative result points with timelines and business impact), and key performance metrics displayed in visually highlighted MetricBlock accent elements. All content must be placeholder-free, professionally written, and contextually accurate for each brand's industry and market. Also update the Portfolio overview section to reflect the addition of the new industry categories covered by these four brands.",
