## Summary
**Goal:** Add four new case study entries to the Portfolio page and generate corresponding brand logos for Melbourne Star Movers, Richard Afkari, Plan Partners, and Matinas Fashion Trunk.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Melbourne Star Movers case study card (removalist/logistics, Australia) with Industry, Market, Budget, Platforms, Objective, Strategy (5–7 bullets), Results (4–6 quantitative points), MetricBlock highlights, and a Visit Website link.
- Add a Richard Afkari case study card (real estate personal brand, Australia) with the same required fields, MetricBlock highlights, and a Visit Website link.
- Add a Plan Partners case study card (financial planning/NDIS, Australia) with the same required fields, MetricBlock highlights, and a Visit Website link.
- Add a Matinas Fashion Trunk case study card (fashion/apparel, India/international) with the same required fields, MetricBlock highlights, and a Visit Website link.
- All four cards use the existing CaseStudyCard component and display their respective generated logos in the card header area.
- Update the Portfolio overview section to reflect the new industry categories introduced by these four brands.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the Portfolio page will see four additional professionally written case study cards with brand logos, metrics, and strategy detail, consistent with the existing site aesthetic.
